# ðŸ‘¥ User Roles

## Purpose

This document defines the user roles, permissions, and access control structure within the Conaprole Orders system. It outlines the responsibilities, capabilities, and security boundaries for each type of system user.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The Conaprole Orders system implements a comprehensive role-based access control system that ensures users can only perform actions appropriate to their business function and organizational level.

### Security Principles

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users receive minimum permissions necessary for their role
2. **Separation of Duties**: Critical operations require multiple roles
3. **Data Territoriality**: Access restricted based on business territories
4. **Audit Compliance**: All actions are logged for security and compliance

## Core User Roles

### 1. Administrator (`admin`)

**Purpose**: System administration and configuration management

#### Responsibilities
- Complete system configuration and maintenance
- User management and role assignment
- System monitoring and troubleshooting
- Data backup and recovery operations

## Permission Structure

### Granular Permissions

The system uses a granular permission structure with the format: `resource:action`

- `orders:write` - Create and modify orders
- `orders:confirm` - Confirm pending orders
- `orders:ship` - Mark orders as shipped
- `orders:cancel` - Cancel orders
- `orders:delete` - Delete orders (admin only)
- `orders:reports` - Generate order reports

#### User Management Permissions
- `users:read` - View user information
- `users:write` - Create and modify users
- `users:delete` - Delete users
- `users:impersonate` - Act on behalf of other users

#### Product Permissions
- `products:read` - View product catalog
- `products:write` - Modify product information
- `products:delete` - Remove products

#### System Permissions
- `system:configuration` - Modify system settings
- `system:monitoring` - Access monitoring tools
- `audit-logs:read` - View audit logs

### Permission Inheritance

    ADMIN[Administrator] --> SM[Sales Manager]
    ADMIN --> DIST[Distributor]
    ADMIN --> POS[Point of Sale]
    ADMIN --> CS[Customer Service]
    
    SM --> LIMITED_DIST[Limited Distributor View]
    DIST --> LIMITED_POS[Limited POS View]
    
    subgraph "Permission Levels"
        HIGH[High Privilege]
        MED[Medium Privilege]
        LOW[Low Privilege]
    end
    
    ADMIN --> HIGH
    SM --> MED
    DIST --> MED
    POS --> LOW
    CS --> LOW
```

## Data Access Patterns

### Territory-Based Filtering

Users with territorial restrictions have data automatically filtered:

```csharp
public class TerritoryFilter : IQueryFilter
{
    public IQueryable<T> Apply<T>(IQueryable<T> query, ClaimsPrincipal user)
        where T : ITerritorialEntity
    {
        var userTerritories = user.GetTerritories();
        return query.Where(e => userTerritories.Contains(e.Territory));
    }
}
```

### Row-Level Security

Critical entities implement row-level security:

```csharp
public class Order : Entity, IOwnedEntity
{
    public Guid OwnerId { get; set; } // DistributorId
    
    public bool CanBeAccessedBy(ClaimsPrincipal user)
    {
        return user.HasClaim("distributor_id", OwnerId.ToString()) ||
               user.IsInRole("admin") ||
               user.IsInRole("sales_manager");
    }
}
```

## Authentication Integration

### Keycloak Integration

The system integrates with Keycloak for authentication and role management:

```json
{
  "realm": "conaprole",
  "auth-server-url": "https://auth.conaprole.com/",
  "ssl-required": "external",
  "resource": "conaprole-orders",
  "credentials": {
    "secret": "client-secret"
  }
}
```

### JWT Token Structure

```json
{
  "sub": "user-uuid",
  "email": "user@distributor.com",
  "realm_access": {
    "roles": ["distributor"]
  },
  "resource_access": {
    "conaprole-orders": {
      "roles": ["distributor", "territory:north"]
    }
  },
  "custom_claims": {
    "distributor_id": "dist-uuid",
    "territory": "north",
    "point_of_sale_id": "pos-uuid"
  }
}
```

## Role Assignment Workflow

### User Creation Process

1. **Administrator creates user account**
2. **Business manager assigns appropriate role**
3. **Territory/location assignment (if applicable)**
4. **Permission verification and testing**
5. **User notification and onboarding**

### Role Change Process

1. **Business justification required**
2. **Manager approval needed**
3. **Security review for privilege escalation**
4. **Audit trail creation**
5. **User notification of changes**

## Security Considerations

### Privilege Escalation Prevention

- Role changes require approval workflow
- Temporary privilege elevation with automatic expiration
- Regular access reviews and certification

### Session Management

- JWT token expiration: 8 hours
- Refresh token rotation
- Concurrent session limits by role
- Automatic logout on inactivity

### Audit and Compliance

All role-based actions are logged:

```csharp
public class RoleBasedAuditLogger
{
    public void LogAction(string action, ClaimsPrincipal user, object resource)
    {
        var audit = new AuditLog
        {
            UserId = user.GetUserId(),
            Action = action,
            Resource = resource.GetType().Name,
            ResourceId = resource.GetId(),
            UserRole = user.GetRoles(),
            Timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow,
            IpAddress = user.GetIpAddress()
        };
        
        _auditRepository.Add(audit);
    }
}
```

## Role Migration and Evolution

### Adding New Roles

1. **Business requirement analysis**
2. **Permission matrix design**
3. **Security impact assessment**
4. **Implementation and testing**
5. **Documentation updates**

### Modifying Existing Roles

1. **Impact analysis on existing users**
2. **Backward compatibility considerations**
3. **Gradual rollout strategy**
4. **User communication plan**

This role-based access control system ensures that the Conaprole Orders platform maintains security, compliance, and operational efficiency while providing users with the appropriate level of access for their business functions.
